# burger

![Picture of App](Desktop/Burger_App.png)

This application utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to make up a burger log. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and also uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML. A remote database was also used through JawsDB in order for the log information to be accessed with the deployed Heroku app.
